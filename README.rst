Overview
========

This project intends to accomplish the following goals: 
  * Ability to recognize handwritten numbers and arithmetic operators
    (``+``,``-``,``/``,``*``, ``=``) in real-time from a video feed
  * Arithmetic expressions are parsed by the software into a plain-text format
  * The expression is sent to WolframAlpha (api?) 
  * The result is displayed on the screen
